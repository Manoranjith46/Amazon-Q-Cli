I Have Created an Awesome game using Amazon Q-Chat
Game Name:
    Shadow Scribe
Game Genre:
    Puzzle, Stealth, Word-based Adventure
Concept:
    You are a magical scribe who must sneak into an ancient, cursed library and "write" spells into the world using keystrokes.
Each typed word influences the environment — unlocking doors, hiding you in shadows, or freezing time — all while avoiding patrolling spirits.
